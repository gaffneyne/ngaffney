<p><a href="https://ngaffney.net/recent/2017/10/orbiter/">In 2017</a> I went to the last Sunday morning of the Tunbridge World's Fair. I liked how the sun rising behind me into the White River Valley made the fair's rides shine, and the oddness of the name Orbiter in the middle of the Vermont landscape.</p>

<p><a href="https://ngaffney.net/recent/2018/10/orbiter_-_2018/">I went back in 2018</a>, and found Orbiter in the same location. I surprised myself by being able to compose the second photo almost identically to the first.</p>

<p><a href="https://ngaffney.net/recent/2019/09/orbiter_2019/">In 2019</a> I went back with intention, imagining how identically composed photographs of Orbiter, each taken a year apart, could anchor <a href="https://ngaffney.net/projects/orbiter/">a larger series of images</a>.</p>

<p>Because of the pandemic there's no 2020 fair. I still went to the fairgrounds. Without Orbiter to focus on, my composition is slightly off from the previous three images. But that seems right. Everything's empty and off these days.</p>
