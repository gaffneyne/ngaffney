<p class="statement">These photographs were taken between May and September 2021. My plan was to document the quiet corners of my family's trips around New England. We're fortunate to live in a place where we can spend a great deal of the summer outside, but the pandemic made that more intentional. I've always been interested in making photographs where things seem left behind. Even if an action is captured it's a quiet one, and more often the image is taken after the "decisive moment" has seemingly come and gone. I was looking for the tension between the memory of things past, and anticipation of what might be next. With Covid was still with us, I chose to photograph in black & white, which I hadn't done since I was a student in a darkroom more than two decades previous. Color would have given the images more weight than I wanted to take on. </p>
